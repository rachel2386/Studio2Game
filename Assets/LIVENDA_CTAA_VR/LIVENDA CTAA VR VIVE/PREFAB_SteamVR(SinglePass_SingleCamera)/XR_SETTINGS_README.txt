Please Make sure You download the Latest SteamVR SDK (This version of CTAA was updated to work with 2.2.0 or later)

PLEASE CHANGE YOUR XR VR Render setting to either MultiPass or Single Pass to correspond with each individual Demo scene.

BEWARE!!!!

As of SteamVR V2.2.0 , after installation and the first time you run the Demo, you will get a warning saying you need to generate an action for SteamVR input. If you do not do this yo will receive a number of errors and it will pause play.  Click yes to generate an action, then in the SteamVR input window click 'Save and Generate' Button below

PLEASE note this has nothing to do with CTAA and this is how the latest SteamVR functions at this stage
