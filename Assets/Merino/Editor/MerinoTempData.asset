      just doubtful about my potential.\n\nDuring my High School senior year, in Argentina,
      I had to take some English exams. The stakes were high.\n\nMonths later, when
      the results came back from England, my teacher was surprised that I didn\u2019t

      rejection can be when I use it as fuel.\n[[Bye.|End]]\n\n\n"
