      section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary
      school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where
      higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university,

      Rejected. And You Should Too.\nTo pull my socks up after a defeat isn\u2019t
      the only thing I\u2019ve learned from my Literature teacher.\n\nShe also taught
      me to love being rejected.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t her intention though. She was
      just doubtful about my potential.\n\nDuring my High School senior year, in Argentina,
      I had to take some English exams. The stakes were high.\n\nMonths later, when
      the results came back from England, my teacher was surprised that I didn\u2019t
      fail. My scores were among the top 15% of the class.\n\nThat\u2019s how powerful
      rejection can be when I use it as fuel.\n[[Bye.|End]]\n\n\n"
