      compulsory.[citation needed] In these systems, students progress through a series
      of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional
      section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary
      school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where
      higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university,

      schools, called private schools. Private schools [1] may be required when the
      government does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools
      can also be religious, such as Christian schools, madrasa, hawzas (Shi'a schools),
      yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard
      of education or seek to foster other personal achievements......\n<<EnterChangeText
