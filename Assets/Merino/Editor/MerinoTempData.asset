      Hey

      Do you know:

      A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and
      learning environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction
      of teachers. Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly
      compulsory.[citation needed] In these systems, students progress through a series
      of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional
      section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary
      school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where
      higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university,
      but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.

      after a defeat isn\u2019t the only thing I\u2019ve learned from my Literature
      teacher.\r\r\nShe also taught me to love being rejected.\r\r\nThat wasn\u2019t
      her intention though. She was just doubtful about my potential.\r\r\nDuring
      my High School senior year, in Argentina, I had to take some English exams.
      The stakes were high.\r\r\nMonths later, when the results came back from England,
      my teacher was surprised that I didn\u2019t fail. My scores were among the top
      15% of the class.\r\r\nThat\u2019s how powerful rejection can be when I use
      it as fuel.\n\n"
