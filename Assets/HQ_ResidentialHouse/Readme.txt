Hi!
Thank you for purchase!

IF YOU HAVE PROBLEMS:

If you have an error about RigidbodyFirstPersonController_custom.cs, 
it means that you already have Standard Character Controller in your project folders. 
To fix this error, you must delete FPSController prefab from the Demo Scene and delete Standard Assets folder from the DemoScene folder. 
After this actions you can put your own character controller in the demo scene, 
add a Sphere collider on the camera of your character controller, 
set this collider to Trigger mode, and set the "MainCamera" Tag to your camera with this Sphere collider.

If doors, windows or switches doesn't work, please check Console for the help info.

All help information about Door and Switch scripts 
you can find in tooltips for almost all variables and properties in the inspector.

IMPORTANT!

To achieve the same graphics as in the video demo and screenshots you need:
1. Set your project to Deferred Rendering Path (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Rendering Path: Deferred);
2. Set your project Color Space to Linear (Edit -> Project Settings -> Player > Color Space: Linear);
3. Switch your camera to HDR mode (Checkbox in the camera component);
4. Add Tonemapper screen effect to your camera from Standard Assets (you can download Standard Unity Assets from Asset Store: https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/content/32351);
5. Add Antialiasing screen effect to your camera from Standard Assets;
6. Add Global Fog screen effect to your camera from Standard Assets;
7. Add Screen Space Ambient Occlusion screen effect to your camera from Standard Assets;
9. Add Bloom screen effect to your camera from Standard Assets;

That's all!
