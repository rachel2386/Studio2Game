Okay. 
Relax. 
It is only the first day of school. Just show up on time for all the classes, and don't say weird things to people, and it will be fine...
That's easy, right?
...Right?
Com'on, R, you got this!
..
(Hope I don't mess up..)

Should I talk to him? (Or should I just pretend I don't see him and walk away?)
