Okay. 
Relax. 
It is only the first day of school. Just show up on time for all the classes, and don't say weird things to people, and it will be fine...
That's easy, right?
...Right?
Com'on, Rachel, you got this!

I guess I should've said Hi..
But I don't want to go through those awkward situations again..
Ugh...
Don't overthink this Rachel! Just head on to class!
