Do you know:
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers.

Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[citation needed] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.

There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools [1] may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, madrasa, hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements. Schools for adults include institutions of corporate training, military education and training and business sc

It's ok. I love rejections. Let me tell you why:

Why I love Being Rejected. And You Should Too.
To pull my socks up after a defeat isn’t the only thing I’ve learned from my Literature teacher.

She also taught me to love being rejected.

That wasn’t her intention though. She was just doubtful about my potential.

During my High School senior year, in Argentina, I had to take some English exams. The stakes were high.

Months later, when the results came back from England, my teacher was surprised that I didn’t fail. My scores were among the top 15% of the class.

That’s how powerful rejection can be when I use it as fuel.
[[Bye.|End]]

This node is called Start_MoreExamples.
The second way to do choices in Yarn is with 'shortcut options' like this:

->This is option 1
	You selected option 1.
->This is option 2
	You selected option 2.
	<<set $didOption2 to true>>

Based on choices, you can set variables, and then check those variables later.
<<if $didOption2 is true>>
By checking $didOption2, I remember you chose option 2!
<<else>>
I can't detect a variable $didOption2, so that means you chose option 1
<<endif>>

Do you want to go back to Start now?
-> Yes, send me back to Start.
	[[Start]]
-> No thanks, I want to stop.

Ok here's the end, good luck!
