???: Hey! Guess what! I got something amazing to tell you!
->Hey.
->(Pretend not to see him)
???:Did you know:
A school is an educational institution designed to provide learning spaces and learning environments for the teaching of students (or "pupils") under the direction of teachers.

-> Sorry, Gotta go.
-> Ugh...so????
-> Oh, I didn't know that.
You:Oh ok.
???: Most countries have systems of formal education, which is commonly compulsory.[citation needed] In these systems, students progress through a series of schools. The names for these schools vary by country (discussed in the Regional section below) but generally include primary school for young children and secondary school for teenagers who have completed primary education. An institution where higher education is taught, is commonly called a university college or university, but these higher education institutions are usually not compulsory.

-> Please let me go.
-> This is SO BORING.Let me go now.
-> Interesting.
You:Ah,right.
???:There are also non-government schools, called private schools. Private schools [1] may be required when the government does not supply adequate, or special education. Other private schools can also be religious, such as Christian schools, madrasa, hawzas (Shi'a schools), yeshivas (Jewish schools), and others; or schools that have a higher standard of education or seek to foster other personal achievements......

???: (Pointing at a glass with halfly filled water)
Hey.You there! What do you see?
->A Half full glass
	A half full glass.I am an optimist I guess.
->A half empty glass
	A half-empty glass.I know I am a pessimist I am sorry.

???: No! A glass that is slightly chipped holding water that isn't cold enough, probably because it's tap water when I asked for bottled water and wait, there's a smudge on the rim, too, which means the glass wasn't cleaned properly and now I'll probably end up with some kind of virus. Why do these things always happen to me?!

You:...

It's ok. I love rejections. Let me tell you why:

Why I love Being Rejected. And You Should Too.
To pull my socks up after a defeat isn’t the only thing I’ve learned from my Literature teacher.

She also taught me to love being rejected.

That wasn’t her intention though. She was just doubtful about my potential.

During my High School senior year, in Argentina, I had to take some English exams. The stakes were high.

Months later, when the results came back from England, my teacher was surprised that I didn’t fail. My scores were among the top 15% of the class.

That’s how powerful rejection can be when I use it as fuel.
